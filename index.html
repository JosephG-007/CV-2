      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <img class="profile-pic" src="Images/profilePic.png" alt="profile-pic">
      <p>My name is Joseph Genovesi and I am learning to code with <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/">The App Brewery</a>. I am a very keen coder and have an unusual set of interests. I really enjoy reading, technology, and lots of other inactive, indoor things, but I also am good at and like many other opposite types of activities. I am very passionate about soccer/football, backyard cricket, skiing, badminton, table tennis, and a few other sports. Currently, in my coding journey, I am learning Javascript after I did CSS, HTML and bootstrap, and also hope go further into the topic with MongoDB, Node.js and more.</p>

        <h3 technology-skill-title>Technology</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned before, I'm a keen tech-geek. Learning to code has been really entertaining for me. I always look forward to the hour or two I spend at night, typing away at the computer. I would also consider myself as tech-savvy, growing up in the 21st century, I think that I have a lot of skills when it comes to technology.</p>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>As well as being a indoorsy person, I really enjoy sports and outdoor activities. Although skiing is my top favourite sport, I am not competitive in it. I enjoy skiing more as a hobbie and a fun once a year trip than a sport. On the other hand, I usually play soccer/football in my training academy at least 3 times per week. Apart from that, I play non-competative table tennis, badminton, cricket, and tennis from time to time.</p>
